An example with multiple panels

::: panel-tabset
## R

Here is some R code

```{r}
lang <- "R"
other_lang <- "python"
sprintf("%s is my favorite language, but %s is great too!", lang, other_lang)
```

## Python

Here is some separate python code

```{python}
lang = "python"
other_lang = "R"
print(f'{lang} is my favorite language, but {other_lang} is great too!')
```

Some more code

::: panel-tabset
## R

Here is some more R code

```{r}
Sys.info()['sysname']
```

## Python

Same with python
```{python}
import sys
sys.platform
```
